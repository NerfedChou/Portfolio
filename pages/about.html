                            I build reliable, maintainable web applications — from API design and backend systems to
                            performant front-end interfaces and thoughtful UX. I focus on clean architecture, testing,
                            and shipping value. As a lifelong learner, I stay updated with the latest technologies and best practices
                            to deliver high-quality solutions. When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring new tech trends.
                            I'm passionate about creating impactful digital experiences that solve real-world problems.

                            I'm always eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities.
                            Taking my talent to the next level is one of the challenge I really want to master.

                    <p class="child-desc">
                        I grew up as a simple person without programming knowledge. My family didn't have much, but we had each other.
                        I was born in a small town in the Philippines, where I spent most of my childhood playing outside with friends and exploring nature.
                        My parents worked hard to provide for us, and they always encouraged me to pursue my dreams.
                        I was fascinated by technology from a young age, and I would often take apart old electronics to see how they worked, to the point a 220V of electricity
                        almost erase my entire existence. My Mom and Dad were not happy about that incident, but they were relieved that I was okay.
                        They found out my strange behavior about school instead of going to learn and follow the system and curriculum, I cut and ditch my class to go to the
                        library and read books about computers and technology.
                        This curiosity eventually led me to discover programming, and I was hooked.
                        Despite the challenges, I was determined to learn and improve my skills.
                        I spent countless hours studying online resources, practicing coding exercises, and building small projects.
                        Over time, I gained more confidence and experience, and I eventually landed my first job as a junior developer.
                        Looking back, I'm grateful for my humble beginnings and the lessons I learned along the way.
                        They taught me the value of hard work, perseverance, and the importance of following my passions.
                        Today, I'm proud of how far I've come, and I'm excited to see where my journey will take me next.

                        led a campus developer group, and contributed to student open-source initiatives. At first, I struggled with
                        balancing coursework and personal projects, but over time I developed strong time management skills and a disciplined
                        work ethic. I also learned the importance of networking and building relationships with peers and professors.
                        These experiences have shaped my approach to problem-solving and teamwork, and I am excited to apply
                        these skills in my future career as a developer.

                          Sir Lawrence (aka "Sir Law") has been my mentor and guide throughout my programming journey.
                          At first I was really scared to interact with him because he is really strict well I can tell.
                            But despite of its strictness, he is also very kind and patient. He always encourages me to push my limits and
                            never give up. He has taught me the importance of discipline, hard work, and perseverance.
                            I am grateful for his guidance and support, and I hope to one day be able to mentor others as he has mentored me.
                            He even hunt me when I cut class and ditch school to learn on online resources.
